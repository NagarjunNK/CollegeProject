            <div style="text-align:center;">   <h7 class="heading" style="font-weight:bold;">     Job Interview Tips </h7></div>

<p>Here are a few more do's and don'ts for being at your best during a job interview.</p>

<h8 class="heading">Job Interview Do's:</h8>

<p>Preparing for a job interview is essential to making a good impression. Employ these handy job interview techniques to win over your interviewer.</p>
    
<ul>      
<li>Plan to arrive on time or a few minutes early. Late arrival for a job interview is never excusable.</li>

<li>Greet the interviewer by their first name.</li>
    
<li>Wait until you are offered a chair before sitting. Sit upright and   always look alert and interested. Be a good listener as well as a good talker. Smile!</li>
    
<li>Maintain eye contact.</li>
    
<li>Follow the interviewer's leads but try to get them to describe the position and duties early in the interview so you can relate your background and skills to the position.</li>
   
<li>Make sure you convey your good points factually and sincerely. Keep in mind that you alone can sell yourself to an interviewer. Make them realise why they need you in their organisation.</li>
   
<li>Always conduct yourself as if you are determined to get the job. Never close the door on an opportunity. It is better to be free to choose from a number of jobs rather than only one.</li>
</ul>

<h8 class="heading">Job Interview Don'ts:</h8>

<ul>
<li>Answer questions with a simple 'yes' or 'no'. Use the CAR technique (Context, Action, Result) wherever possible. Share things about yourself relating to the position.</li>
    
<li>Lie. Always answer questions truthfully, frankly and as concisely as possible.</li>
    
<li>Ever make derogatory remarks about your present or former employers, colleagues or companies.</li>
    
<li>'Over-answer' questions. The interviewer may steer the conversation into politics or economics. It is best to answer the questions honestly, saying no more than is necessary.</li>
     
<li>Let your discouragement show. If you get the impression the interview is not going well and you have already been rejected, don't show discouragement or alarm. Occasionally an interviewer who is genuinely interested in you may seem to discourage you in order to test your reaction.</li>

<li>Ask about salary, bonuses or holidays at the first interview - unless you are positive the employer is interested in hiring you and raises the issue first. However, know your market value and be prepared to specify your required salary or range.</li>

</ul>

 <div style="text-align:center;"><h7 class="heading" style="font-weight:bold;"> 10 TIPS TO IMPROVE INTERVIEW PERFORMANCE</h7></div><br>
<h8 class="heading">Practice good nonverbal communication</h8>
<p>It's about demonstrating confidence: standing straight, making eye contact and connecting with a firm handshake. That first nonverbal impression can be a great beginning -- or quick ending -- to your interview.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Dress for the job or company</h8>
<p>Today's casual dress codes do not give you permission to dress as "they" do when you interview. It is important to know what to wear to an interview and to be well-groomed. Whether you wear a suit or something less formal depends on the company culture and the position you are seeking. If possible, call to find out about the company dress code before the interview.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Listen</h8>
<p>From the very beginning of the interview, your interviewer is giving you information, either directly or indirectly. If you are not hearing it, you are missing a major opportunity. Good communication skills include listening and letting the person know you heard what was said. Observe your interviewer, and match that style and pace.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Don't talk too much</h8>
<p>Telling the interviewer more than he needs to know could be a fatal mistake. When you have not prepared ahead of time, you may ramble when answering interview questions, sometimes talking yourself right out of the job. Prepare for the interview by reading through the job posting, matching your skills with the position's requirements and relating only that information.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Don't be too familiar</h8>
<p>The interview is a professional meeting to talk business. This is not about making a new friend. Your level of familiarity should mimic the interviewer's demeanor. It is important to bring energy and enthusiasm to the interview and to ask questions, but do not overstep your place as a candidate looking for a job.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Use appropriate language</h8>
<p>It's a given that you should use professional language during the interview. Be aware of any inappropriate slang words or references to age, race, religion, politics or sexual orientation -- these topics could send you out the door very quickly.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Don't be cocky</h8>
<p>Attitude plays a key role in your interview success. There is a fine balance between confidence, professionalism and modesty. Even if you're putting on a performance to demonstrate your ability, overconfidence is as bad, if not worse, as being too reserved.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Take care to answer the questions</h8>
<p>When interviewers ask for an example of a time when you did something, they are asking behavioral interview questions, which are designed to elicit a sample of your past behavior. If you fail to relate a specific example, you not only don't answer the question, but you also miss an opportunity to prove your ability and talk about your skills.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Ask questions</h8>
<p>When asked if they have any questions, most candidates answer, "No." Wrong answer. Part of knowing how to interview is being ready to ask questions that demonstrate an interest in what goes on in the company. Asking questions also gives you the opportunity to find out if this is the right place for you. The best questions come from listening to what you're asked during the interview and asking for additional information.</p>
<h8 class="heading">Don't appear desperate</h8>
<p>When you interview with the "please, please hire me" approach, you appear desperate and less confident. Reflect the three Cs during the interview: cool, calm and confidence. You know you can do the job; make sure the interviewer believes you can, too.</p>
